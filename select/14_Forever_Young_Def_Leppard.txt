The cracks are starting to show
'Cause you've had it real bad
You've had it real bad
Your mind is starting to blow
'Cause you want it real bad
You want it real bad

Your heart is such a deep divide
And your love is just a love denied
And you want to be
Forever young, forever young

You got a hunger for lust
But the high is too much
It's always too much
The world gets in your face
It's throwing you round
It's pushing you down

Your heart is such a deep divide
And your love is just a love denied
And you want to be
Forever young, forever young

Your heart is such a deep divide
And your love is just a love denied
And you want to be
Forever young, forever young

Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
